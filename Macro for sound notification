This macro can be used when some data are regularly refreshed in a specific sheet and table by Power Query, for example, and there is a need to action asap when a specific value occurs in the table.
The macro is checking in a Sheet1, a Table1 and column Y. When 'XXX' appears in the column Y the macro will ring. The macro is checking the column every 15s but it can be modified. In order to stop the macro, there is a sub called StopSoundRefresh(). 




Dim continueRefresh As Boolean

Sub CheckTableForNewCase()
    Dim ws As Worksheet
    Dim tbl As ListObject
    Dim rng As Range
    Dim cell As Range
   
  
    Set ws = ThisWorkbook.Worksheets("Sheet1")
    Set tbl = ws.ListObjects("Table1")
    Set rng = tbl.ListColumns("Status").DataBodyRange
   
    ' When "XXX" is in column Y, it will ring
    For Each cell In rng
        If cell.Value = "XXX" Then
            Beep ' Sound
            Exit For
        End If
    Next cell
   
    If continueRefresh Then
    ' For Checking every 15s
    Application.OnTime Now + TimeValue("00:00:15"), "CheckTableForNewCase"
    End If
End Sub


Sub StopSoundRefresh()

    continueRefresh = False

    
End Sub

Sub StartSoundRefresh()
    continueRefresh = True
    CheckTableForNewCase
End Sub
